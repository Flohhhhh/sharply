# Capturing Images

Gear images for thumbnails should be front facing images captured at 50mm, deep apertures like f/8 or f/9, and with no lens on the camera.

Sensor will be digitally enhanced or replace in final result if needed.

# Finding Images

To find images start by looking for a manufacturer press release. They often include images intended for news and press use available for download.
It is absolutely essential that you do not ever grab images from sites other than manufacturers sites. Images from sites like DP Review or other review sites are strictly off limits.

## For Cameras
Make sure to use the front facing image with no lens (sensor showing). If one is not available, choose the best available front-facing image. Prefer w body cap, then w/ lens if needed.

## For Lenses
Prefer a horizontal left facing (front element facing left, mount facing right) image with front element visible. If one is not available, look for a vertiaclly aligned image with front element visible that can be rotated to face left.

# Processing Images

- Import into Photoshop
- Remove background if there is one, make sure edges are clean, no white or black left
  - Make sure to remove any holes for straps or in small details
  - Sometimes it helps to do (Select > Modify > Contract > 1px. Do this before sizing the image down.)
- If it's a lens and not facing left (front element toward left) rotate into that orientation
- Crop tightly on all edges (aspect ratio does not matter)
- If image is larger than 1000px wide, do Image > Image Size > Select "Pixels" for Width > Type 1000px for pixel value leaving resolution at 72 and resampling automatic
- Export as .webp (File > Save As or Save a Copy > Format = webp)
  - Select 75% quality, do not include any metadata or extras

# Uploading Images

After processing the image properly and saving it as a webp, admins can visit the gear item's page and click "manage image" button on right side to upload the image
