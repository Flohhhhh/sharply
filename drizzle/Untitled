step numbering is inconsistent: the heading after "Step 1: Test Schema Changes
Locally" jumps to "Step 3: Backfill Data"; update the heading "Step 3: Backfill
Data" to "Step 2: Backfill Data" so steps are sequential. Locate the "Step 3:
Backfill Data" heading in the docs (near the "npm run db:push" block and
references to the gear_mounts table) and rename the heading text only, ensuring
the copy and any internal anchors or TOC entries remain consistent.
